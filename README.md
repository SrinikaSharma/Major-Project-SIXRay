**The Triple Threat : YOLOv5, YOLOv8 & YOLOv9 
Reinventing X-Ray Security**

In today's rapidly evolving security landscape, ensuring the safety and protection of public spaces and 
transportation infrastructure is of utmost importance. Traditionally, this screening process has relied heavily on 
manual inspection by trained security personnel, who examine X-ray images of baggage 
and parcels to identify suspicious items. However, manual 
inspection is time-consuming, prone to human error and may struggle to keep pace with the ever increasing volume of passengers and luggage passing through transportation hubs.
To address these challenges, this 
project introduces an innovative approach using deep learning and computer vision 
techniques. The aim is to improve threat detection accuracy within X-ray images using YOLO. A user-friendly interface has been developed that provides real-time visualization of X-ray 
images and detected threats, facilitating informed decision-making by security personnel.
